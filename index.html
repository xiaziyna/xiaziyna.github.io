	<h1> Jamila Taaki </h1>
        <h2> Hello </h2></div>
	</div>

        <p>I am a PhD student in <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>.
	I am jointly advised by <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/farzadk">Professor Farzad Kamalabadi</a> (ECE) and <a href="https://astro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/akemball">Professor Athol Kemball</a> (Astronomy) since 2017.</p>
	Before joining Illinois, I completed an Msci. in Astrophysics at <a href="https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/">Royal Holloway University of London</a>.
	
	<p>
	My research interests are focused on signal processing applied to exoplanet science. 
	In particular, I combine statistical inference and computational methods for transiting exoplanet telescopes.
	I apply my research at scale using <a href="https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/">Bluewaters</a>.</p>

	<h2> Projects/Ongoing Work </h2>
	<p> We were recently awarded a <a href="https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/science-teams?page=detail&psn=bbek">Bluewaters allocation</a> for it's final year of operations. 
	The allocation will be used to perform a search for exoplanets in the first year of TESS high cadence data.</p>

	<h2> Past Research Work </h2>
	<p><i> (2015) Open University Mars Climate Lab, supervised by <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/people/srl89">Professor Stephen Lewis</a>. Internship and temporary researcher.</i> </p>
	<p>While there, I studied entry landing and descent for Martial vehicles. I also looked at seasonal ice-cap variation using Martial climate simulations.</p>
